# 1. Part 1 - Bugs
(1) A failure-inducing input for the buggy program:
```
@Test 
public void testReverseInPlace1() {
  int[] input1 = { 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 };
  ArrayExamples.reverseInPlace(input1);
  assertArrayEquals(new int[]{ 11, 9, 7, 5, 3 }, input1);
}
```
(2) An input that doesnâ€™t induce a failure:
```
@Test 
public void testReverseInPlace2() {
  int[] input1 = { 3 };
  ArrayExamples.reverseInPlace(input1);
  assertArrayEquals(new int[]{ 3 }, input1);
}
```
(3) The symptom, as the output of running the tests:
![Image](test.png) <br>
(4) The buggy code:
```
static void reverseInPlace(int[] arr) {
  for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) {     
    arr[i] = arr[arr.length - i - 1];
  }    
}
```
The fixed code:
```
static void reverseInPlace(int[] arr) {
  for(int i = 0; i < arr.length/2; i += 1) {  
    int temp = arr[i];
    arr[i] = arr[arr.length - i - 1];
    arr[arr.length - i - 1] = temp;
  }
}
```
# 2. Part 2 - Researching Commands
(1) grep -c: displays the count of matching lines instead of the actual lines (resource: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/grep-command-in-unixlinux/)
```

preface.txt:0
```
This command line prints a count of lines in each file in the folder 911 report that contains the word "flight". We can see most of the files contain many lines with the word "flight", which is consistent with the topic -- 911report. In this way, we can know the main thing that happened in 911 was about the flight.

This command line prints a count of lines in each file in the folder government/About_LSC that contains the word "gender". By using this command, we can know which file is talking about the gender topic and which file considers more about the gender topic.<br>
(1) grep -n: displays line numbers along with the matching lines (resource: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/grep-command-in-unixlinux/)
```

160:transgendered persons, persons with AIDS, children, homeless
170:transgendered persons, people of color, people from diverse
418:religious groups and gays/lesbians/bi-sexual and transgender
```
Since this command displays the lines containing "gender" and their line numbers, it makes it easier for us to locate which part is talking about the gender topic in the file.

Since this command displays the lines containing "kill" and their line numbers, it makes it easier for us to locate which part is talking about the number of casualties on 9/11.
