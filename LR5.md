I am doing lab7. I clone the required code as instructed. The instruction ask me to fix some bug in the codes. Before fixing the bug, I want to make sure that some tests do fail. So I run "bash test.sh". But it gives me these errors.
Here is the test.sh I cloned from the code Professor provide.

What is the problem with it? I didn't change anything but only cloned the code.
